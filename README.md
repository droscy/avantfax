## AvantFAX 3
AvantFAX is a web based front-end for the [HylaFAX](http://www.hylafax.org/) fax server software.

It was developed with Object Oriented PHP and MySQL.
This will allow administrators to use a browser to manage users, their permissions, fax lines, categories, etc; and will allow users on any platform to view and send faxes while on the local network or away from the office.

AvantFAX was written by David D. Mimms, Jr. `david(at)avantfax.com`
