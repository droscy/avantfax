Installing AvantFAX
---

You can use the rh-install.sh script for RHEL5, CentOS 5, and Fedora Core 4 and better.
Similar scripts are available for SLES 10 (sles-install.sh) and Debian (debian-install.sh).
Please send suggestions directly david at avantfax.com.


NOTE: Only run the script once or risk adding duplicate configuration settings to sudoers and the HylaFAX configuration files.

The rh-install.sh does the following:

- Installation of all required packages via yum
- Updates PHP PEAR libraries
- Configures HylaFAX's JobFmt and faxmail for AvantFAX
- Installs AvantFAX files
- Configures Apache virtual hosting for AvantFAX
- Disables SELinux for Apache, allowing you to leave SELinux enabled on your server
- Creates the AvantFAX MySQL user and database
- Symlinks the AvantFAX faxrcvd and notify scripts to HylaFAX's $SPOOL/bin
- Replaces HylaFAX's faxcover with AvantFAX's faxcover
- Configures sudo
- Configures HylaFAX $SPOOL/etc/config and $SPOOL/etc/config.tty* to use AvantFAX's custom scripts
- Automatically adds any configured HylaFAX modems to AvantFAX's database
- Sets up root's crontab for the AvantFAX housekeeping scripts

There is another script for configuring Email to FAX.  For details, see email2fax.txt

Manual installation
---

### Install
 
You will need a working installation of the following:
  - HylaFAX 4.4, HylaFAX 6, or HylaFAX EE 3 & 4
  - PHP 5 or 7
  - PHP MySQL
  - composer 1.9.0
  - MySQL server 4.1.12 or better (see Important Notes below)
  - Apache
  - ImageMagick
  - ghostscript
  - libtiff
  - netpbm-progs
  - libungif
  - sudo
  - sendmail/postfix/exim/qmail or use an external SMTP server
  - cups/lpr and psutils

You may already have some of the above packages installed with your working installation of HylaFAX.


### Before Installation:
 
 ** NOTICE **
 ** If your PHP5 interpretor uses path /usr/bin/php5 instead of /usr/bin/php,
 ** I advise you to make a symlink for /usr/bin/php OR update the path in
 ** avantfax/includes/faxrcvd.php, notify.php, remold.php, faxcover.php, and phb.php.

You must take a look at avantfax/includes/local_config.php to verify the settings
for your system. If you only have local_config-example.php, you must rename it
to local_config.php.

Settings of interest:

  - $dft_config_lang
    This is the default system language for AvantFAX. You can change it to any
    language you have installed in avantfax/includes/lang/

  - $HYLAFAX_PREFIX
    If you installed HylaFAX from RPM, it may be installed in /usr while a SOURCE
    installation will default to /usr/local. This means that if the program sendfax
    is in /usr/bin/sendfax, $HYLAFAX_PREFIX should be "/usr". The same thing goes
    for other source installations like ghostscript and ImageMagick.

  - Take a look at the other options in case you need to change the defaults
    For working Outbox support for usernames of 15 characters in length, JobFmt
    in /etc/hylafax/hyla.conf should read:

    #
    ## AvantFAX configuration
    #
    JobFmt: "%-3j %3i %1a %15o %40M %-12.12e %5P %5D %7z %.25s"


### Installation:

If you feel your system is ready for installation, here are the steps:

 1- Move the avantfax/ directory to it's installation location (ex: /srv/www/avantfax)

    Example:
    # mv avantfax /var/www/
    # chown -R apache.apache /srv/www/avantfax
    # chmod -R 0770 /srv/www/avantfax/tmp /srv/www/avantfax/faxes
    # chown -R apache.uucp /srv/www/avantfax/tmp /srv/www/avantfax/faxes


 2- Symlink AvantFAX's faxrcvd and notify scripts to your HylaFAX spool bin directory.

    Example:
    # ln -s /srv/www/avantfax/includes/faxrcvd.php /var/spool/hylafax/bin/faxrcvd.php
    # ln -s /srv/www/avantfax/includes/dynconf.php /var/spool/hylafax/bin/dynconf.php
    # ln -s /srv/www/avantfax/includes/notify.php /var/spool/hylafax/bin/notify.php


 3- Modify the modem config files for the devices you want to use with AvantFAX.
    You can add the following to the bottom of the config.devid file (ie: ttyS1 or boston03).

    Example:
    # vim /var/spool/hylafax/etc/config.ttyS1
    
      #
      ## AvantFAX configuration
      #
      FaxrcvdCmd:     bin/faxrcvd.php
      DynamicConfig:  bin/dynconf.php
      UseJobTSI:      true


    # vim /var/spool/hylafax/etc/config
    
      #
      ## AvantFAX configuration
      #
      NotifyCmd:      bin/notify.php


 4- Make sure PEAR Mail_mime is installed.

    Example:
    # pear install Mail Net_SMTP Mail_mime MDB2_driver_mysql


 5- Make your AvantFAX database. At the prompt, enter your MySQL root password.

    Example:
    # mysql -uroot -p < create_user.sql
    # mysql -uavantfax -pd58fe49 avantfax < create_tables.sql


 6- Add two scripts to avantfax's crontab (/etc/cron.d/avantfax): one for creating 
    a phonebook file for WHFC; the other for removing AvantFAX temporary files,
    automatically archiving faxes, and automatically deleting faxes from the Archive.

    Example: /etc/cron.d/avantfax

      # runs once an hour to update the phone book
      0 * * * * /srv/www/avantfax/includes/phb.php
      # runs once a day to remove old files
      0 0 * * * /srv/www/avantfax/includes/avantfaxcron.php -t 2

    More information about avantfaxcron.php can by found by executing:
    # /srv/www/avantfax/includes/avantfaxcron.php


 7- Comment out "Defaults requiretty" and add an entry for Apache to add and delete 
    fax users, and to halt and reboot the server via sudo.

    Example:
    # visudo
    
      www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/faxdeluser, /usr/sbin/faxadduser -u * -p * *


 8- You can now log into the admin to create user accounts. Login to the admin
    interface via web browser and go to the admin/ directory.

    Example: http://10.0.0.1/admin/

    The default Admin login username and password are:
    username: admin
    password: password

    Once you login, you will be required to change the password. Be sure to change
    your email address in the Admin Settings.


### Post Installation:
Once you have installed AvantFAX, you may wish to import your already received
faxes in your hylafax spool directory. First, in the Admin interface, create all
of the modems you plan to use with AvantFAX and their alises.

  Example 1:
    device: ttyS0
    alias: Sales
    contact: sales@companyname.com

  Every fax that arrives through modem ttyS0 will be email in PDF format to
  sales@companyname.com as well as listed in the AvantFAX Inbox.

  Example 2:
    device: ttyS1
    alias: Support
    contact: 

  Every fax that arrives through modem ttyS1 will only be shown in the AvantFAX Inbox.


Now, you may use the following command by substituting ttyS0 with your modem device
to import your already received faxes:

  # cd /var/spool/hylafax; for i in `ls recvq/*`; do bin/faxrcvd.php $i ttyS0; done
 
To import your sent faxes, try running this:

 # cd /var/spool/hylafax; for i in `ls doneq/q*`; do bin/notify.php $i done :30; done

 
Important notes:
This fax interface was developed on Fedora Core 4 using:

    PHP 5.0.4 with mime_content_type
    PHP PEAR 5.0.4
    PHP MySQL 5.0.4
    PHP PEAR Mail_mime
    MySQL 4.1.16
    Apache 2.0.54
    ghostscript 7.07
    ImageMagick 6.2.2
    HylaFAX 4.2.5
    libtiff 3.7.1
    netpbm 10.31
    libpng 1.2.8
    libungif 4.1.3

Apache 1 or an earlier version of Apache 2 will probably work because we have not
configured anything special with Apache. We simply use the php5 module and have
a VirtualHost configured for http://avantfax/

Example we use for Apache 2:

  NameVirtualHost *:80
  <virtualhost>
    DocumentRoot /srv/www/avantfax
    ServerName avantfax
  </virtualhost>

MySQL 4.1.11 was found to have a bug in it when using BOOL columns. Version 4.1.12 fixed this problem.
